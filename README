This project implements a concept in graph theory called graph coloring.It is a way of coloring the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The user marks some nodes and arcs from their profile. The javascript running behind sends this to google_appengine. In appengine processing is done to color the graph and decided color send to userprofile.
